Medium-Term Goals
+++++++++++++++++
A. I got a working answer to challenge 2.8.1, but it was very different from the book's answer, so I removed it. I want to see what other changes might happen
to the code before I implement the book's solution.

Long-Term Goals
+++++++++++++++
A. Revise the language to become a strongly-typed language. In fact, this goal might be better served by starting a new language from scratch.
B. Add arrays and maps.
